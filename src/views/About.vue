              Meetapp is an open source video conferencing platform,
              built on top of Jitsi by the Living Open Source (Africa) Foundation's community.
              <br />
              The need to build an online meetup platform was necessited by the
               the community's expansion, need to have meetups and share ideas beyond borders.
               <br />
               The outbreak of COVID-19 made the need even greater. Truly, necessity is the mother of
               all inventions.
